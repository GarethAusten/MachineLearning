    "# Fast Differentiable Sorting and Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08871.pdf) out of Google Brain proposing the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators that achieve a time complexity of _O(n log n)_ and a space complexity of _O(n)_. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by constructing differentiable sorting and ranking operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries / Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{\\theta} := (\\theta_{0}, ... , \\theta_n) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$ where $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ can be thought of as a vector of scores or logits produced by a model. e.g., In a label ranking setting $\\theta$ might contain the scores for each of $n$ labels for the features $x$.\n",

    "A permutation of $[n]$ by $\\sigma = (\\sigma_0, ..., \\sigma_n)$ and it's inverse by $\\sigma^{-1}$ sometimes refering to $\\pi := \\sigma^{-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a permutation $\\sigma$ is seen as a vector, it's denoted with bold as $\\mathbf{\\sigma} \\in [n]^n$. We denote the set of $n!$ permutations of $[n]$ by $\\Sigma$. Given a permutation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma$ we denote the version of $\\mathbf{\\theta} = (\\theta_0, ..., \\theta_n) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$ permuted according to $\\sigma$ by $\\theta_{\\sigma} := (\\theta_{\\sigma1}, ..., \\theta_{\\sigma n}) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define the reversing permutation by $\\rho := (n, n-1, ..., 1)$ or $\\mathbf{\\rho}$ in vector form. Given a set $S \\subseteq [n]$ and a vector $\\textbf{v} \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$ we denote the restriction of $v$ to $S$ by $v_{S}:= (v_i: i \\in S) \\in \\mathbf{R}^{|S|}$\n",

    "where $\\theta_{\\sigma_1}(\\theta) \\geq ... \\geq \\theta_{\\sigma_n}(\\theta)$. If some of the coordinates of \\theta are equal, ties are broken arbitrarily. The sort of $\\theta$ is defined as the values of $\\theta$ in descending order i.e., \n",
