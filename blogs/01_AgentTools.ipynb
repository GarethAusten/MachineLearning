    "# The Importance of Tools in Developing AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In my last [post](https://www.garethausten.com/blog/what-is-an-ai-agent), I talked about what an AI Agent is and how it learns and reasons about it's environment to make effective decisions. At the core of an Agent is a Large Language Model (LLM), these LLMs contain a vast amount of knowledge but this knowledge is limited in recency up to the last date that data was gathered for training. If, for example, we want an agent to conduct company research on to prepare a sales rep for an upcoming pitch then LLMs are unlikely to have the latest company news contained in their training data. How do Agents get around this shortcoming... by using tools to query the web, interact external APIs and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic wrote an excellent blog post on [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) where they describe when it's appropriate to build an agent vs a workflow and how in either scenario the LLM is augmented by Retrieval, Tool Calling and Memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tools allow agents to retrieve real-time data, perform domain-specific tasks, and ultimately provide more reliable and actionable outputs. In this post, we’ll explore how to build a company research agent — an agent that, given a company name or domain, conducts research to return key information and recent news — using two agentic frameworks: OpenAI Swarm and crewAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Tools Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs are excellent at generating human-like text and reasoning, they often lack up-to-date or specialized knowledge about the real world. By integrating tools such as web scrapers, APIs for company information (like Clearbit, Crunchbase, or NewsAPI), or custom modules for data aggregation, you enable your agent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access Real-Time Data: Get the latest news or financial data about a company.\n",
    "* Perform Specialized Tasks: Scrape websites, query databases, or interact with external APIs.\n",
    "* Improve Accuracy: Combine the LLM’s reasoning capabilities with factual data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This synergy allows your agent to be more than just a conversational partner—it becomes an interactive assistant that can perform end-to-end research tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Company Research Agent: Concept Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an agent that accepts a company name (e.g., “openai.com” or “OpenAI”) and then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tFetches Key Company Information: Details such as the company’s mission, founders, industry, and recent milestones.\n",
    "2.\tRetrieves Recent News: The latest headlines or news snippets related to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent accomplishes this by invoking various “tools” that might query a company database or a news API. For each framework, the agent is given a set of instructions and access to a web-search tool from crewAI. Let’s see how we might build this using two different frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Building with OpenAI Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI Swarm is a framework that allows you to orchestrate multiple specialized tools (or “agents”) to work in parallel and aggregate their outputs."
